# Edit-Distance-Metrics

Accumulations of various algorithms to help calculate edit distances.

## Current Metric

- [Hamming Distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_distance)

## I plan to add more Metrics by the end of this year.

- [Levenshtein distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance)
- [Jaro–Winkler distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaro%E2%80%93Winkler_distance)
- [Longest common subsequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longest_common_subsequence_problem)
- [Damerau–Levenshtein distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damerau%E2%80%93Levenshtein_distance)
